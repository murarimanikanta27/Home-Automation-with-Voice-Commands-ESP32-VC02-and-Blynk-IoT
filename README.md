# Home Automation with Voice Commands, ESP32, VC02, and Blynk IoT

## Overview

This project involves creating a home automation system that responds to voice commands to control various appliances, such as a motor, fan, bed light, and room light. The ESP32 microcontroller serves as the core of the system, interfacing with the VC02 voice recognition module and the Blynk IoT app. The VC02 module has custom firmware that allows it to directly control the appliances. For example, when you say "light on," the VC02 will directly send the command to the ESP32, which will turn on the light.

## Features

- **Voice Control with Custom Firmware**: The VC02 module, with custom firmware, allows direct control of appliances through voice commands.
- **Remote Control**: Control appliances via the Blynk IoT app from anywhere with an internet connection.
- **ESP32-Based**: The ESP32 handles communication between the VC02 module, the Blynk app, and the appliances.
- **Multiple Devices**: Control a motor, fan, bed light, and room light with voice commands or remotely.

## Components

- **ESP32**: The microcontroller that interfaces with the VC02 and Blynk app, controlling the appliances.
- **VC02 Voice Recognition Module**: Captures and processes voice commands, sending them directly to the ESP32 to control the appliances.
- **Blynk IoT App**: Provides a user-friendly interface for remote control of appliances.
- **Relay Module**: Used to switch the motor, fan, bed light, and room light on and off.
- **Motor**: An appliance that can be controlled by the system.
- **Fan**: Another appliance controlled by the system.
- **Bed Light**: A light source controlled by the system.
- **Room Light**: Another light source controlled by the system.
- **Power Supply**: Powers the ESP32 and connected appliances.

## Wiring Diagram

1. **VC02 Voice Recognition Module**:
   - VCC to 3.3V on ESP32
   - GND to GND on ESP32
   - TX to a digital pin (e.g., RX pin of ESP32)
   - RX to a digital pin (e.g., TX pin of ESP32)

2. **Relay Module**:
   - Connect the relay IN pins to digital pins on the ESP32 (e.g., D5, D18, D19, D21).
   - Connect the relay output terminals to the motor, fan, bed light, and room light.
   - The relay VCC and GND pins connect to 5V and GND from the power supply.

3. **Appliances**:
   - Connect the motor, fan, bed light, and room light to the relay module outputs.
   - Ensure the relay can handle the voltage and current required by each appliance.

4. **ESP32**:
   - Connect the ESP32 to the VC02 module, relay module, and power supply as described above.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/home-automation-voice-esp32.git
   cd home-automation-voice-esp32
   ```

2. **Upload the Code**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE or another suitable IDE for ESP32 development.
   - Install the necessary libraries for Blynk, VC02, and relay control if they are not already installed.
   - Open the `home_automation.ino` file from the repository.
   - Connect your ESP32 to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Select the correct board (ESP32 Dev Module) and port from the IDE.
   - Click on the Upload button to upload the code to the ESP32.

3. **Flash Firmware to VC02**:
   - Ensure that the custom firmware has been correctly flashed to the VC02 module.
   - The firmware should enable the VC02 to recognize voice commands like "light on" and send the appropriate signals to the ESP32.

4. **Configure Blynk App**:
   - Download the Blynk app on your smartphone and create a new project.
   - Add buttons or switches for the motor, fan, bed light, and room light.
   - Link each button or switch to the corresponding digital pins of the ESP32.
   - Obtain the Blynk Auth Token from the app and insert it into the `home_automation.ino` code.

5. **Assemble the System**:
   - Connect the ESP32, VC02 module, relay module, and appliances as per the wiring diagram.
   - Ensure all connections are secure and correct.

6. **Power On**:
   - Power the ESP32 and connected appliances.
   - The system should be ready to respond to voice commands and remote control via the Blynk app.

## How It Works

1. **Voice Commands**: The VC02 voice recognition module listens for pre-defined voice commands (e.g., "light on"). With the custom firmware, it directly processes these commands and sends a signal to the ESP32.
2. **ESP32 Processing**: The ESP32 receives the signal from the VC02 and activates the corresponding relay to control the appliance (e.g., turning on the light).
3. **Blynk Control**: Users can also control the appliances via the Blynk IoT app, sending commands over the internet to the ESP32, which then triggers the relays.

## Troubleshooting

- **Voice Commands Not Recognized**: Ensure the VC02 module is properly powered and connected to the ESP32. Verify that the firmware was correctly flashed and that the voice commands are correctly programmed.
- **Appliance Not Responding**: Verify the relay connections and ensure that the ESP32 is correctly triggering the relay. Check the power supply to the appliances.
- **Blynk App Not Connecting**: Make sure the ESP32 is connected to Wi-Fi and that the correct Auth Token is used. Ensure the Blynk app is set up with the correct digital pins.
